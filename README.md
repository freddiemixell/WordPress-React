# WordPress React Theme

> I've been working with React and WordPress a lot lately and I thought to myself, "Wouldn't it be nice if we didn't need a WordPress Install and a separate website running on node that displayed the frontend?" After a little research I found [React WP Scripts](ttps://github.com/humanmade/react-wp-scripts) by [Human Made](https://github.com/humanmade), as well as [Create React WPTheme](https://github.com/devloco/create-react-wptheme) on Github. 

# New Features!

  - All WordPress posts and pages now available on frontend with my custom routes and Page.js/Blog.js Template components.
